</PRE><H1><A NAME=v37r7>2010-08-25 Brunel v37r7</A></H1><PRE>
This version uses projects LCG 58e, Gaudi v21r10p1, LHCb v31r4, Lbcom v9r6,
 Rec v10r4 and SQLDDDB v5r34, ParamFiles v8r3, FieldMap v5r5, AppConfig v3r*

This version requires ParamFiles >= v8r3, Det/DDDB >= v1r34

- NB: This version of Rec and LHCb require new Database tags otherwise processing will fail.
  DDDB must be >= head-20100826
	LHCBCOND must be >= head-20100831
  SIMCOND depends on the data being analysed
  Consult the defaults in Det/DDDB for more information
  Det/DDDB has been updated with these new defaults

- Updated references for tests.

- This version pick up the latest geometry and event model changes
  from LHCb and Lbcom. 

- The Luminosity methods have been updated to allow for -log(P), and write those FSRs
  but this requires a full reprocessing before they can be used

- Tracking and Vertexing have been updated to more appropriate cuts,
  timing has also been improved slightly

- The DDDB, SIMCOND, LHCBCOND tags required to use this software have been
  updated. The software is not strictly backward-compatible on the old DB tags.
  head-20100826 tags should be used. Det/DDDB v1r34 contains the new defaults.

- Det/DDDB v1r34 and Rich/RichRecTrackTools v1r24p1 have been absorbed. 
  . Rich/RichRecTrackTools v1r24p1 fixes bug #72136.
  . Det/DDDB v1r34 fixes many backwards-compatibility problems

      the tracking 
  . Add MoniGENERALSeq sequence, with the following algorithms (RecConf v1r2):
    o New monitor for ProcStatus processing aborts. Fill a single histogram
      with the abort rates (%) overall and by sub-system (RecAlgs v1r9)
    o New monitor for the event processing times. Takes a list of algorithm
      names, uses the ChronoSvc to sum the processing time per event for them,
      and produces some basic plots (RecAlgs v1r9)
    o ChronoSvc output level increased, to avoid duplicate timing table
  . Add plot to monitor total number of photon candidates (RichRecQC v2r43)
  . Add counter for number of tracks changing sign (TrackFitter v2r49)

 and SQLDDDB v5r11, ParamFiles v8r1, FieldMap v5r2, AppConfig v3r*

This is a development version for changes subsequent to the 2009 MC production. 
Output requires DaVinci v24r3 to v24r*

 - Changes to configuration:
   . Reorganisation of charged ProtoParticle algorithms for greater flexibility:-
     + New algorithm creates ProtoParticles from Tracks, but no longer adds any
       PID information
     + One algorithm per PID information to be added to the ProtoParticles.

   . Introduction of configurables for Calo, and reorganisation of Calo sequences
     (CaloKernel v6r0, RecSys v7r6, CaloPIDs v5r0, CaloReco v5r0)

 - Persistency changes:
   . Changes to Track class: add members for likelihood and ghost probability,
     remove obsolete ExtraInfo enums. Backward compatibility for MC09 data is
     preserved by the EventPacker. Backward compatible also when reading DC06
     data, but access to obsoleted ExtraInfo items requires changing code to use
     the obsoleted enums. (TrackEvent v5r0, EventPacker v1r7, PackedEvent v3r6,
     CaloTools v5r11, RichRecQC v2r33, RichRecTrackTools v1r14, NNTools v1r6,
     TrackCheckers v4r8, TrackMonitors v1r13, TrackTools v3r21)
   . ExtraInfo is removed at the end of the tracking sequence and not written
     to output (TrackSys v4r25, TrackUtils v1r29)

 - New tuning:
   . Added support for zipped InstallArea/python directories on the PYTHONPATH,
     speeds up the python configuration part of the initialisation (Gaudi v21r4)
   . New default DB tags for 2009 data: head-20090902 for DDDB and LHCBCOND,
     sim-20090902-vc-md100 for SIMCOND. Fixes rotation of Rich1 HPDs, updates IT
     dead strip+noise files, fixes material for track fit (SQLDDDB v5r11, v5r10)
   . MagneticFieldSvc now uses a MagneticFieldGrid object, reduces virtual
     function calls of track fit (Magnet v5r4, DetDesc v18r15, LHCbKernel v11r7)
   . All Rich monitors booked at initialisation, speeds up filling by removing
     hash table lookup at each plot call (RichKernel v7r26)
   . Track fit now initialises itself, does not try to use OT drift times in
     first iteration. Removes need for explicit prefits
     (TrackSys v4r25, PatVeloTT v3r8, TrackFitter v2r37, TrackProjectors v2r24)

This version uses projects Gaudi v21r3, LHCb v27r5, Lbcom v7r5, Rec v7r5
 and SQLDDDB v5r9, ParamFiles v8r1, FieldMap v5r2, AppConfig v3r*

This is a development version for changes subsequent to the 2009 MC production. 
Output requires DaVinci v22r3 or from v24r1

 - Changes to configuration:
   . Change default data type to "2009"
   . Propagate SpecialData property to ConfiguredMuonIDs (RecSys v7r5)
   . Moved addition of z-position reference nodes from configuration into fit to
     simplify configuration (TrackFitter v2r36, PatVeloTT v3r7)

 - Persistency changes
   . Reorder the Status bit field in MuonPID to preserve DC06/MC09 compatibility.
     Since LHCB v27r0 (Brunel v35r0) the bit order was different from DC06/MC09,
     implies that DaVinci v23r0 to v24r0 should not be used to access
     "InAcceptance" and "PreSelMomentum" bits of MuonID status on DC06/MC09 DSTs.
     (RecEvent v2r21)

 - New tuning:
   . Prevent creation of local MsgStream objects by caching one per detector 
     element, speeds up geometry access (VeloDet v13r8)
   . MuonID changes (MuonID v7r1)
     o Track fit disabled for cosmics
     o Change findTrackRegion to use region in M2 or M3 instead of M2 only
     o Skip Prob calculation only if no valid region in M2 AND M3
   . Store Muon PID information in charged ProtoParticles when
     MuonPID::IsMuonLoose is true, not MuonPID::IsMuon (GlobalReco v6r24) 
   . Changed chi2 cut again to recover more efficiency (PatVelo v3r16)
   . Added hot sector rejection to prevent exponential in time trigger behaviour
     with very hot events with many ghosts (PatVelo v3r16)
   . Changed prefitters to run only single iteration (TrackFitter v2r36)
   . Added state for last measurement (TrackFitter v2r36)

 - Bug fixes:
   . Fixed small bug in updating ref vectors in TrackMasterFitter. This had as a
     consequence that we were running the 2nd iteration of the Prefit for nothing
     since it would not actually use this as a reference in the normal fit. 
     Now, we can just a single iteration prefit with no change in fitter output.
     (TrackFitter v2r36)

 - New packaging:
   . Use AppConfig v3r*

 - Monitoring changes
   . Technical changes to speed up monitoring code (CaloMoniDst v3r9)
   . Do not try to access MC information when MC is disabled
     (RichRecMCTools v2r24, RichRecQC v2r32, RichMCTools v3r12, RichKernel v7r25)
   . Update RichRecoQC and RichTracklessRingMoni to use new histogramming 
     methods in Rich/RichKernel. Improves CPU usage a little and also moves
     histogram booking to initialize() (RichRecQC v2r32, RichKernel v7r25)
   . Suppress some monitors that combine all track types to "Expert" mode.
     In practice, the individual track type monitors are more useful.
     (RichRecQC v2r32)
   . Modifications to VeloTrackMonitor histograms (VeloRecMonitors v1r11)

 - Changes to example options:
   . In MC09 example options, set MC09 DataType and remove import *

- New tuning
  . Modified HPD description to speed up initialization 
    (SQLDDDB v5r9 with head-20090708 tag or later, DetDescCnv v4r9)
  . New implementation of MuonID (MuonID v7r0)
    o IsMuonLoose condition (which takes the OR of the muon hits in FOI instead
      of the AND) is now the "default" condition (instead of IsMuon) for the
      first step of the MuonID. The DLL is built only if the IsMuonLoose is true
    o Muon Tracks are stored in the MuonPID object only if IsMuonLoose is true
    o MuonPID objects are stored in the ProtoParticle only if IsMuonLoose is true
    o IsMuon is still kept as member of the MuonPID object, it can be recovered
      whenever it is needed. IsMuon=true data set is always a subsample of the
      IsMuonLoose=true data set
  . Changes to track selection for ProtoParticles (GlobalReco v6r2)
    o Suppress all Velo and Tracks from being made into ProtoParticles
    o Add loose track selection criteria to charged ProtoParticle creation. 
      Current cut is track Chi^2/d.o.f. < 50
  . Changed the PatVelo chi^2 cut to optimise for MC09 signal (not Minimum Bias).

 and DDDB v1r* (SQLDDDB v4r7 or greater), ParamFiles v7r2, FieldMap v5r*

This is a development version.
- Should be used to reconstruct 2008 geometries
- Can be used for DC06 geometries, but material seen is different from DC06

      (bank version SIM=63) (OTDAQ v7r1)
    o If accessing TT raw banks in 2008 data or simulation, due to fixes to 2008

     (#include "$BRUNELOPTS/BrunelTrOtItTT1.opts" was ItOt)

! =================================================================
</PRE><H1><A NAME=v9r1>20020320 Brunel v9r1</A></H1><PRE>
   Adds support for dbases v243r3, v243r1p1 (comparative study of TT1 options). 
   Includes several bug fixes (see below)
 
   In options
   - Brunelv243r3.opts, BrunelTrItOtTT1.opts: new files to support dbase v243r3
   - Brunelv243r1p2.opts: new file to support dbase v243r1p2
   - BrunelTr*.opts all touched to make them consistent with new files above
   - Brunel.opts: enable Calorimeter OO reconstruction (without persistency)
   - BrunelMoni.opts: disable ITDigitMonitor (crashes for dbase v243r3)

   In requirements
   - use LHCbEvent    v12r2 Event
     AxPartCandidate.h - initialisation-value for m_fitCovariance set to (6,0).
                         (needed by serializers)

   - use ITEvent      v7r2  Event
      Bug fixes in ITDetectionLayer and ITChannelID, should solve problem 
      of missing hits reported by O. Callot
   - use ITAlgorithms v8r1  IT
      Bug fixes in ITDigitCreator, Add ITDigitEffMonitor class

   - use CaloEvent    v7r1  Event
      fix problems with std::maps on Win2K

   - use Velodet      v3r1  Det
    . Change the 'type' of the wafers, to handle properly the separation between
      left and right detectors, this was not done for R and was incorrect for 
      Phi. The result was an inefficiency in the overlap region (vertical).
    . Fixes a few minor problems of boundary, by increasing tolerances to see
      if a hit is compatible with a region of the other detector.
    . When matching R-Phi, if the slope from the nominal vertex is too big,
      one use an extrapolation parallel to the Z axis and an increased tolerance.

   - use simmubg      v5r3  SICB
      murwhits.F - Bug fix : The original (before muon background addition) 
                   number of ATMC objects in the last partition (pile-up event) 
                   is now correctly counted.

  This is the first version to be used for an official LHCB production 

  This version has been restructured as two packages. Rec/Brunel contains the
  statically linked code needed to run SICBDST routines. C++ components of the
  reconstruction framework have been moved to the package Rec/BrunelKernel

  There are two subdirectories in /src:
    BrunelSicb   contains interface code to SICB (statically linked)
    ObsoleteSicb contains interface code to SICB that is no longer used
                 because SICB algorithms have been replaced by equivalent 
                 C++ algorithms.
  Files have been rename to avoid multiple . in filenames (to please nmake)

  Job options file structure has been modified relative to Brunel v1r6

  requirements use explicitly the SICB packages, no longer SICBDST

  #### Physics changes with respect to SICBDST v252 ####
  - Uses C++ tracking 
    Intermediate tracking banks (e.g. WIDG, WODG) are not produced
