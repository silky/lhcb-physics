#Select with plot you want to produce: TOTAL (total cross section vs energy), INEL (inelastic cross section vs energy), MULTI (multiplicity vs energy)

finalPlot: TOTAL

#Set "plotdata" to 1 if you want to plot on your graphs COMPASS data, where available (p, pbar in Al and Be total cross section), in caso of ratios this will plot the PDG ratios 

plotData: 0

#Set "Ratios" to 1 if you want the ratio between two particle guns, useful to make ratios particle/antiparticle
#NB: ATTENTION!! If doRatio = 1 in order for this to work you have to list the pguns in sequence "particle, antiparticle, particle, antiparticle, ecc"
#NB: Ratio will be done only for first material and thickness

doRatios: 0

#Set "print" to 1 if you want to print histograms with PDG ID od daughters, 0 if not (all histograms are saved in rootfiles anyway)

print: 0

#Set the models to use
N.B.:No more than 2 models per analysis if you put more the rest will be ignored

Models: QGSP_BERT 

#Set the particle guns you want to use: "Piplus", "Piminus", "Kplus", "Kminus", "p", "pbar" are available

ParticleGuns: Piminus 

#Set the energies of your particles in GeV: any energy available, write just number without units

Energies: 1 5 

#Set the materials in which you want to fire your particles: "Al", "Be", "Cu", "Si", "Pb" are available

Materials: Al 

#Set the thicknesses of this material in mm, write just number without units
