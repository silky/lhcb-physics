! Package     : Sim/GaussKine
! Responsible : Gloria CORTI
! Purpose     : Code to exchange kinematic information with Geant4
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2008-10-29 - Patrick Robbe
 - SimulationToMCTruth: remove particles which are left with 
   null production vertex after Geant4, because of interactions
   (mainly Lambda interactions) which destroyed the particle

! 2008-10-23 - Patrick Robbe
 - In SimulationToMCTruth: check if pdg code from Geant4 is unknown
   and don't create a vertex for a particle reaching Geant4 'world'
   volume

! 2008-10-20 - Patrick Robbe
 - Add new algorithms to send and retrieve MCTruth to/from G4
   . GenerationToSimulation: generator HepMC -> Geant4 
   . SimulationToMCTruth: Geant4 -> MCParticles/MCVertices

! 2008-10-08 - Gloria CORTI
 - Move printout to debug level
   . G4HepMCToMCTruth.cpp

! 2008-09-23 - Patrick Robbe
 - GeneratorToG4.cpp: fix optical photon polarization part

!========================= GaussKine v3r0 2008-08-25 ========================= 
! 2008-07-25 - Patrick Robbe
 - Move to HEPMC2

!========================= GaussKine v2r1 2008-06-27 ========================= 
! 2008-06-12 - Patrick Robbe
 - Add the modifications for optical photon particle gun in GeneratorToG4

!========================= GaussKine v2r0 2008-05-07 ========================= 
 2008-05-07 - Gloria CORTI
 - Remove GaussKine_load.cpp obsolete for Gaudi v19

! 2008-04-26 - Patrick Robbe
 - GeneratorToG4.cpp: specify mass of shortlived particles

!========================= GaussKine v1r7 2007-10-05 ========================= 
! 2007-10-03 - Gloria Corti
 - Adapt to change in contructor of ParticleID from int being explicit
   (as in LHCbKernel v7r7 in LHCb v22r9)
   . G4HepMCToMCTruth.cpp

!========================= GaussKine v1r6 2007-08-17 ========================= 
! 2007-08-17 - Gloria Corti
 - Introduce protection as to pass an empty event to G4 when the 
   LHCb::HepMCEvents container is empty. This will reset the internal
   G4Event. 
   . GeneratorToG4.cpp
 - Introduce protection as not to retrieve MCTruth info for empty events
   since it cannot be cleared if G4 does not call User Event Action 
   . G4HepMCToMCTruth.cpp

!========================== GaussKine v1r5 2007-02-08 ========================
! 2007-01-12 - Gloria Corti
 - Use Gaudi macro for factories so to be comaptible with both Gaudi v18
   and v19:
   . G4HepMCToMCTruth.cpp
   . GeneratorToG4

!========================== GaussKine v1r4 2006-06-07 ========================
! 2006-06-07 - Patrick Robbe
 - GeneratorToG4: HepMC event units for time are ns, so do the boost
   correctly with mm for position and ns for time.

!========================== GaussKine v1r3 2006-05-02 ========================
! 2006-05-02 - Gloria CORTI
 - Use MCTruthManager::SplitBarCode to choose if to collapse a particle,
   this should set behaviour as in DC04 for Brem electrons (before number 
   checked was 10 times that set)
   . G4HepMCToMCTruth.cpp 

!========================== GaussKine v1r2 2006-04-12 ========================
! 2006-04-12 - Gloria CORTI
 - Introduce filling of table with correspondece between MCParticle and 
   barcodes in HepMC (i.e. G4TrackID) held by GiGaKineSvc to allow algorithms
   filling MCHits later in the sequence to set SmartRef.
 - Retrieve priamries from G4 and update list help in MCHeader for primaries.
   Attach primary particles having the same production position as one of
   the primary vertices, since in HepMC they have different vertices even if
   the position is the same.
 - Set vertex type according to creator process associated to the corresponding
   HepMC vertex, if a particle oscillated reset its decay vertex to be
   of type OscillatedAndDecay.
 - While primary HepMC particles are always in the same order that is not
   true for the children of a given particle, so sort them before making 
   the MCParticle so that those are always in the same order. 
   . src/G4HepMCToMCTruth.{h,cpp}

!========================== GaussKine v1r1 2006-03-27 ========================
! 2006-03-27 - Patrick Robbe
 - GeneratorToG4: switch MeV units in HepMC particles

!========================== GaussKine v1r0 2006-02-07 ========================
! 2006-02-06 - Chris Jones
 - Add work arounds for non const accessors in MCEvent.
   Uses const_cast = Preferable to adding non-const accessors though

! 2006-01-26 - Gloria CORTI
 - First version of the package, with code imported from GaussAlgs and
   modified to adapt to new Event Model
   . G4HepMCToMCTruth.{h,cpp}
   . GeneratorToG4.{h,cpp}
