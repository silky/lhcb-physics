!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!========================== GaussRICH v4r3 2003-09-30 ======================
! 2003-09-30 - Sajan Easo
 -  RichHpdPhotoElectricEffect.cpp - fix for the ToF

!========================== GaussRICH v4r2 2003-09-03 ======================
! 2003-09-03 - Florence Ranjard
 - use RichEvent v* ( instead of v4r*)

! 2003-08-19 - Witek Pokorski
 - removed some printouts from the converters

!========================== GaussRICH v4r1 2003-07-28 ======================
! 2003-07-28 - Witek Pokorski
 - RichPhotoElectron - changed pdg id in order to avoid conflict with e-
 - modified RichInfo to use DetTrackInfo base class introduced to GaussTools

!========================== GaussRICH v4r0 2003-06-16 ======================
!2003-7-22 - Sajan Easo
   Modified the rich1 upstream photon killing to cope with the
   fact that at preuser tracking, the trackvertex is not available.
   Also photons created at and after the exit wall of the rich1 are
   killed. 
! 2003-07-16 - Sajan Easo
 - convertor for the MCRichHit structure at the output.
 - Optimizations for reducing cpu time in Rayliegh.
 - Boundary process optimizations for rich2.

! 2003-07-07 - Florence RANJARD
 - fix for gcc3.2

! 2003-6-18 - Sajan Easo
     Added more info into RichG4Hit. Cleanup of how the
     hpd energy loss processes was activated.
     Checks for existence of Gausstracking info in
       RichG4CherenkovPhotProdTag and  RichPEInfoAttach 
       (By Witold).

!========================== GaussRICH v3r0 2003-06-18 ========================

! 2003-06-02 - Sajan Easo
   For cpu optimization, the killing of photons which were going to be
  killed in the HPDs, is implemented  in the preuser track action of  
  dedicated user track action for photons.
! 2003-05-29 - Ivan BELYAEV
 - src/SensDet/GiGaRichHitCnv.cpp fix 'GiGaFlush problem' 
                                  (explicit dependence on conversion order) 
 - cmt/requirements               increase the version 


!=========================== GaussRICH v2r2 2003-04-29 ========================
!2003-04-29 - SE
 - Modification to be compatible with the richInfo pointer
   from the GaussTrackInformation of the GaussTools package.


!=========================== GaussRICH v2r1 2003-03-05 ========================
!2003-03-21 - SE  
  - Modifed  various parts to make a running version with
  - Gauss v9r1. 
  - Activated the Rich2 by modifying RichHpdProperties
  - Implemented UserTrackinformation to optical photons and
  - photoelectrons so that the hits will have lot of informations
  - regarding the history of the Cherenkvo process. These are to
  - be used inthe debugging stage of the Rich-Brunel.
  - This version also needs the modifications that are made in the
  - Sim/GaussTools/v6r2/src/Components/CutsStepAction.cpp and
  - GiGaTrackActionSimple.cpp so that the photons and photoelectrons
  -  are not killed and the UserTrackInformation set in GaussRICH is
  - is used for photons and photoelectrons.
  - Also added a couple of paprameters in the options file
  - for the verbosity of output and histogram activation.
  -  Three of the .cc files from G4 version 4.5.0.ref02 is 
  - copied and modifed for the optiomization and filling track related
  - UserInformation. These are in the src/srcG4 subdirectory.

! 2003-03-05 - Florence RANJARD
 - replace PhysicalConstants.h (from Geant4) with 
           CLHEP/Units/PhysicalConstants.h
! 2003-01-23 - Vanya Belyaev
    few fixes for Win2K platform 

!=========================== GaussRICH v2r0 2002-12-17 ========================
! 2002-12-17 - Witek Pokorski
 - use new GaussTools (new Geant4)  

!=========================== GaussRICH v1r0 2002-12-11 ========================
! 2002-12-11 - Witek Pokorski
  - New package: contains all RICH specific implementations of sensitive
                  detectors, converters and physics process
