! Package     : Sim/GaussRICH
! Responsible	: Sajan Easo 
! Purpose     : collection of sensitive detectors, G4 actions, etc for RICH
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
!2008-04-15 - Sajan Easo
    - Fixed a problem in RichG4Analysis6.cpp and RichG4Analysis3.cpp for the HpdSMaster names.
    - Fixed a problem in RichG4Analysis5 for Rich2 mirror name.
!2008-04-11 - Sajan Easo
  - Added the minor changes needed to accomodate the new Rich1 Flat mirrors
    geometry structure in the database. The name changes are kept backward
    compatible so that one can run with earlier versions of db released in 2008.

!2008-03-31 - Sajan Easo
  - Added a switch to Rich.opts to override the Hpd maxQE value in the DB.
    The RichG4TrackActionPhotOpt is modified to use this. The default of the
    switch is 'false', which means the DB value is used. 
    To override this, in Rich.opts, set RichHpdMaxQEOverRideDB=true and 
    assign the new value to RichHpdMaxQEValueWhenOverRideDB
!2008-03-27 - Sajan Easo  
  - Made changes to accomodate the recent changes in xml geometry for RICH, which created 
   one logical volume per hpd. This was to simulate the Silicon chip shifts inside the hpd.
   The changes are in RichG4GaussPathNames.h and RichG4StepAnalysis3.cpp and in the part
   making a test analysis reconstruction of data from hpds.
  - cleanup of the way the sensitive detector name is used in RichSensDet
!========================= GaussRICH v8r0 2008-02-20 =========================
! 2008-02-20 - Gloria CORTI
 - Increase major version number since it does NOT work with DC06 geometry
   but only staring with head-20080130.
! 2008-01-31 - Rob Lambert, Sajan Easo
 - Fixed a problem in RichG4StepAnalysis6.cpp which was preventing the flags
   for the various hpd reflections from being recorded into the userparameters
   for the track and hence into the RichG4hit.

! 2008-01-30 - Sajan Easo
 - Fixed a problem with transport of backscattered photoelectron and the hit 
   it creates by modifying RichHpdSiEnergyLoss.cpp

! 2008-01-29 - Sajan Easo, Marco Musy
 - Added the reading of HPD QE Tables from the conditions DB. This would read
   one table per HPD. An switch is available in Rich.opts to activate the 
   reading of the nominal QE table from sqldddb. 
   The default is set to reading the tables from Conditions DB.
 - The HPD Demag reading is modified to read from the Conditions Database
   via the RichDet so that the magnetic field distortions can be applied 
   directly from the conditions database.
   A switch is available in Rich.opts to use the old cross-focussing parameters
   used for DC06 which are useful for the no-magetic field running.
 - The default for the HPD PSF is set to the new value set after DC06. This
   would give a slightly worse resolution than that used for DC06. 
   A Switch is available in Rich.opts to use the DC06 compatible PSF value.
 - In RichG4StepAnalysis5.cpp modified the the mirror number assignment in 
   accordance with the new Rich1 and Rich2 mirror configurations from Jan2008
   in the database. In Rich1, this means using the 4 CMA mirrors and
   in Rich2 this means using the envelope volumes of the mirror.

! 2008-01-29 - Chris Jones
 - Add summary printout for each type of HPD reflection background, not just
   an overall summary.

! 2008-01-28 - Chris Jones
 - Activate the filling of the HPD reflection flags in the MCRichHits by
   default.
   Requires the head of Event/MCEvent
 - Tidy up things a little.

! 2008-01-25 - Sajan Easo 
 - In RichHpdPhotoElectricEffect and HpdSiEnergyLoss processes, the 
   RichPhotoelectron is activated insted of the normal  G4Electron as the
   secondary particle created. This is seems to work ok with Gaussv30r5.
 - GetMCRichHitsAlg.cpp and GetMCRichOpticalPhotonsAlg.cpp are modified in
   preparation for modifications in the MCRichHit and MCRichOpticalPhoton 
   classes. The changes are commented out for now. The MCRichHit is expected
   to have additional flags for the new HPD simulation. 
   The MCRichOpticalPhoton class is expected to have the photon
   coordinate on the hpd quartz window.

! 2008-01-23 - Sajan Easo 
 - In the RichG4Hit add the location of the Photon incidence point on the 
   external surface of the HPD quartz window so that it can be copied to the 
   MCRichOpticalPhoton class for Hpd debugging studies. This is done from the
   Step action named RichG4StepAnalysis6.cpp and is activated only with the
   RICH verbose output flag. 

! 2008-01-21 - Sajan Easo, Rob Lambert
 - Changes in accordance with the new geometry changes in RICH in January 2008.
 - Change in RichHpdPhotoElectricEffect to account for an extra layer of 
   containerof hpd array in RICH2.
 - New Hpd Simulation from Rob Lambert which addes chromium ring around each
   hpdquartz window. It also has new values for the reflectivities for the 
   various optical boundaries in the hpd,rescaling of QE table and an improved
   simulation of the backscattering inside the hpds. These involves changes 
   mainly in RichHpdPhotoElectricEffect.cpp,RichHpdEnergyLossProcess.cpp, 
   RichHpdProperties.cpp, RichG4OpBoundaryprocess.cc and the files related to
   these. The photons which are reflected in the various hpd boundaries and 
   the photoelectrons created by backscattering process are flagged in the 
   RichG4hit class. One result of this is to add about 10% noise
   hits to the set of rich hits.
 - HPD Max QE is seto 0.45 in the new sqldddb. This has the effect of 
   increasing the CPU  Time.

!======================== GaussRICH v6r8 2006-11-09 ===========================
! 2006-11-02 - Sajan Easo
 - For aerogel the Rayleigh scattering has a check on how many times a photon
   gets scattered and if this is above a cut value from the options file, 
   the photon gets killed.
   Added a PreUsertrackaction in RichG4TrackActionAerogelPhoton which checks
   the momentum of the photons from aerogel and if above a cutoff value then
   kill those photons.
   This is so that in the xmldddb can be set to  produce the photons in the
   full momentum range which is from 1.5 to 6.5 eV and depending upon the
   filter is used or not, the photons to be filtered out are killed in
   GaussRICH to save cpu time from going through the Rayleigh scattering.

! 2006-10-30 - Sajan Easo
 - Integrated the Hpd Magnetic field Distortion implementations from M.Musy
   The parameters for this are read in from the XmlConditions DB.
   This can be activated from a switch in Rich.opts, named 
   RichUseHpdMagDistortions
   The current default is to switch this off. To activate this the Rich xml 
   parameter UseHpdMagDistortions need to be set to 1.0  as well. 
 - For the HPD PSF , made a switch in Rich.opts named RichPSFPreDc06Flag. 
   The default is 'true' which is to set to the parametrization set at the
   beginning of DC06.
   When it is set to false, the new parametrization is activated which
   worsens the resolution by a small amount as shown from recent testbeam
   results.
 - The RichAnalysis is fixed for the test reconstruction . The fixes included 
   changing the names of userparameters for the mirrors and the hpd numbering
   scheme in accordance with the xmldddb. 

!======================== GaussRICH v6r7 2006-10-11 ===========================
! 2006-10-26 - Sajan Easo
 - Hpd Numbering scheme made compatible with the recent changes for RICH2

 - Improved the RichAnalysis for histogramming the hpd QW hits info
 - As part of the 'extended output info' , the calculation for the location of
    exit point of the photon from aerogel fixed using the raidator numbers.
 - Introduced the flags to have the HpdMagnetic field distortions read in
   from the conditions database. The current default is not to read these distortion info
   and just use a quadratic law.

! 2006-02-22 - Chris Jones
 - Update the setting of the sensDetID in the MCRichHits

   empty MCRichSegment container is found.

!======================== GaussRICH v6r0 2006-01-31 ===========================
! 2006-01-31 - Gloria CORTI
 - Need to compile RichG4AnalysisPhotElec and RichG4Counters from RichAnalysis
   to run Gauss, otherwise there are unresolved symbols

! 2005-12-16 - Gloria CORTI
 - New options RichExtendedInfo.opts that allow to print info about and write
   on file additional MC classes.
 - Rich.opts, comment options about GiGaGetHitsAlg since default in GaussAlg 
   v1r8 

2005-12-09  - Sajan Easo
  - The photons not converted at the photocathode are allowed to travel inside the HPD.
    This is the improve the simulation of various backgrounds inside HPD.
  - The fresnel loss at the aerogel exit boundary and  aerogel filter surfaces are activated in
    the  RichG4OpBoundaryProcess.cpp. 
  - To avoid infinite loops due to total internal reflections in rectangular blocks like the filter
    and aerogel, a maximum number of steps (default 5000) is set for the photons in the  RichG4OpBoundaryProcess. 
  - The default Hpd anode efficiency changed from 0.9 to 0.85. 
  - The hit convertor is changed to an algorithm named GetMCRichHitsAlg which is to be activated from
    Simulation.opts. The hit collection list labels modified to have the ability to do partial storage of hits
    for different of the RICHs. The default is to store all the hits.
  - The ExtendedRichInfo convertors are all put into an algorithm named GetExtendedMCRichInfoAlg
    and the RichVerbose.opts modified accordingly. The GetMCRichHitsAlg and GetExtendedMCRichInfoAlg are
    loaded from Simulation.opts
  - The use of moveUpHistory replaced with GetReplicaNumber whenever G4TouchableHistory is used. This
    is to stay compatible with recent versions of G4.These changes are in RichHpdPhotoElectricEffect.cpp
    and  RichSensDet.cpp
  - The demagnification law changed to linear + quadratic for the HPDs in RichHpdPhotoElectricEffect.cpp

!======================== GaussRICH v5r1 ==================================
! 2005-12-09 - Gloria CORTI
 - Introduce options (defaultin Rich.opts) to use RichConditions for setting
   the refractive index of the gases. 

! 2005-11-07 - Chris Jones
 - Remove unneccessary "use" statement for RichCondition. Technically, 
   GaussRICH only requires the interfaces from RichCondition to compile so
   the use state for RichCondition is redundant.

! 2005-09-30  - Sajan easo
 - Added RichG4RunConditionAction.h and RichG4RunConditionAction.h which
   are to activate the RichCondition tool. The RichCondition tool
   interface is in Rich/RichKernel. Hence this version needs both the
   RichCondition and RichKernel packages. The requirements file is
   modified accordingly. 

! 2005-09-02 - Chris Jones
 - Add some more counters to GiGa converter for MCRichHits to monitor for
   various problems

!======================== GaussRICH v5r0 ==================================
2005-08-20   - Sajan Easo
- Add montoring Print statements to EventAction to verify the
  refractive indices from RichCondition. This is done using the
  RichG4InputMon.h and  RichG4InputMon.cpp and modifying the RichG4EventAction
  By default this is switched off. To activate this one needs to set
  GiGa.EventSeq.RichG4Event.RichG4InputMonitorActivate=true;
  in RichAnalysis.opts.
- Changed some histogram limits in RichG4HistoDefineSet1.

!======================== GaussRICH v4r15 ==================================
!2005-06-16 - Sajan Easo
  - The DetectorElement member functions userParameterAsInt and 
    userParameterAsDouble replaced by param<int> and param<double> to be 
    compatible with recent changes in DetDesc. 
  - All usage of IDetectorElement to DetectorElement to be compatible with
    recent DetDesc.

!2005-05-10 - Sajan Easo
  - In RichAnalysis/RichG4ReconFlatMirr.cpp the xml userparameter names 
    refering to the direction of the flat mirrors changed in accordance 
    with names in recent xml versions.
    Also the quartic equation solution now uses GSL based algorithm.
    This is not used in standard running, but only activated in verification
    software for special studies.

!======================== GaussRICH v4r14 ==================================
!2005-04-19  - Sajan Easo
  - Added three montoring histograms for set2 to plot the 
    number of  nonraditor hits.
  - Added counters to keep track of the number of nonradiator hits.

!======================== GaussRICH v4r13 ==================================
! 2005-04-12 - Gloria Corti
 - options/RichAnalysis.opts 
   . switch off set 3 of histograms

!2005-04-06  - Sajan Easo
  -Upgrade of the Gauss Monitoring histograms: The set2 and set histograms have 
    modified title and range and the set2  also include plots of 
    Cherenkov production theta vs track momentum.
  - Modification of all the files under srcG4 area so that they 
    are similar to the corresponding files in the 
    recent versions (v4.7.*) of GEANT4. 
    These are only cosmetic changes like using std::sin(x) instead of sin(x).

!======================== GaussRICH v4r12 ==================================
! 2005-03-07 - Chris Jones
 - Remove redundant information from MCRichSegment

!======================== GaussRICH v4r11 ==================================

! 2004-06-02 - Sajan Easo
  - Created RichPhotoelectron particle for transport inside HPD.
  - It still has 2 GeV/c momentum to ensure straight line tracking.
    A low momentum of 20 keV has devaition from straight line when
    tracked by B=0 field tracking. 
  - the photoelectron has only transportation and hpdenergyloss process.
  - Files modified are GiGaPhysConstructorHpd.cpp and .h, 
     RichHpdPhotoElectricEffect.cpp, RichHpdSiEnergyLoss.cpp
  - Fixed the GiGaMCRichHitCnv.cpp to avoid the division by 10 for the
    the energy of the hit which is the energy deposted by photoelectron.
    Typcial energy of the hit is 20 keV.
  - Process Type created for all processes defined in GaussRICH.
  - Coordinates of Photon Reflection points on spherical and flat Mirrors 
    added to RichG4Hit so that they can be accessed when running in 'Verbose Output' mode.
  - Added the functionality to set different max number 
    of Cherenkov photons created per step in the three different Radiators.
    These values can be set from Rich.opts file. The default setup is to use a single
    value for all radiators.
  - Further cleanup of Rich.opts, RichVerbose.opts and RichAnalysis.opts.

 - Clean up of Rich.opts so that commented options refer to tools instances
   as in standard simulation
 - Clean up of RichVerbose.opts so that it can be included in addition to
   Rich.opts

! 2004-03-26 - Chris JONES
 - Few little changes for CPU optimization

!========================= GaussRICH v4r7 =================================
! 2004-03-17 - Sajan Easo
 - Modified GiGaPhysConstructorOp.cpp to avoid suspending the
   tracking of charged track which creates optical photons 
   until those photons are tracked. This is to get around a 
   problem in G4 and GiGa whereby the G4trajectory of the 
   suspended charged track was lost and a new G4trajectory was created
   when its tracking resumed

!======================== GaussRICH v4r6 =================================.
! 2004-02-09 - Chris Jones
 - Added two new converters for MCRichTracks and MCRichSegments
 - General minor improvements to the code

!========================= GaussRICH v4r5 =================================
!2004-2-4 - Sajan Easo
 - Added more info to the UserTrackInformation of photons, photoelectrons
 - Added more user info data to the RichG4hit class. Description of 
 - these addtional variables are in the RichG4hit class definition. 
 - setup a VerboseMode Activation switch so that these additional user info data are
 -  switched off during normal production run. They can be switched on
 -  for special runs. options/Rich.opts is for standard run.  
 -  The options/RichVerbose.opts and RichAnalysis.opts are for special studies.
 -  Modified the PhysProcess/ RichG4OpBoundaryProcess.cpp and 
 -   RichG4OpRayleigh.cc to be compatible with G4.6.0, although the changes are
 -  only cosmetic.
 -  Added some of the Analysis software for verification of
 -  cherenkov angle resolutions, photoelectron yield  etc. 
 -  This Analysis software is switched off for standard runs.
 -  Modified the Simulation.opts for the optical processes in the line
 -  GiGa.ModularPL.PhysicsConstructors += {"GiGaPhysConstructorOp/OpPhysOptions"};
 -   This is to provide two variables through the Rich.opts to the Optical Physics
 -   process list. Default values are provided in the program for normal production runs.  
! 2003-12-15 - Witek Pokorski
 - RichG4OpBoundaryProcess - fixes for G4.6.0

! 2003-09-30 - Sajan Easo
 -  RichHpdPhotoElectricEffect.cpp - fix for the ToF

!========================== GaussRICH v4r2 2003-09-03 ======================
! 2003-09-03 - Florence Ranjard
 - use RichEvent v* ( instead of v4r*)

! 2003-08-19 - Witek Pokorski
 - removed some printouts from the converters

!========================== GaussRICH v4r1 2003-07-28 ======================
! 2003-07-28 - Witek Pokorski
 - RichPhotoElectron - changed pdg id in order to avoid conflict with e-
 - modified RichInfo to use DetTrackInfo base class introduced to GaussTools

!========================== GaussRICH v4r0 2003-06-16 ======================
!2003-7-22 - Sajan Easo
   Modified the rich1 upstream photon killing to cope with the
   fact that at preuser tracking, the trackvertex is not available.
   Also photons created at and after the exit wall of the rich1 are
   killed. 
! 2003-07-16 - Sajan Easo
 - convertor for the MCRichHit structure at the output.
 - Optimizations for reducing cpu time in Rayliegh.
 - Boundary process optimizations for rich2.

! 2003-07-07 - Florence RANJARD
 - fix for gcc3.2

! 2003-6-18 - Sajan Easo
     Added more info into RichG4Hit. Cleanup of how the
     hpd energy loss processes was activated.
     Checks for existence of Gausstracking info in
       RichG4CherenkovPhotProdTag and  RichPEInfoAttach 
       (By Witold).

!========================== GaussRICH v3r0 2003-06-18 ========================

! 2003-06-02 - Sajan Easo
   For cpu optimization, the killing of photons which were going to be
  killed in the HPDs, is implemented  in the preuser track action of  
  dedicated user track action for photons.
! 2003-05-29 - Ivan BELYAEV
 - src/SensDet/GiGaRichHitCnv.cpp fix 'GiGaFlush problem' 
                                  (explicit dependence on conversion order) 
 - cmt/requirements               increase the version 


!=========================== GaussRICH v2r2 2003-04-29 ========================
!2003-04-29 - SE
 - Modification to be compatible with the richInfo pointer
   from the GaussTrackInformation of the GaussTools package.


!=========================== GaussRICH v2r1 2003-03-05 ========================
!2003-03-21 - SE  
  - Modifed  various parts to make a running version with
  - Gauss v9r1. 
  - Activated the Rich2 by modifying RichHpdProperties
  - Implemented UserTrackinformation to optical photons and
  - photoelectrons so that the hits will have lot of informations
  - regarding the history of the Cherenkvo process. These are to
  - be used inthe debugging stage of the Rich-Brunel.
  - This version also needs the modifications that are made in the
  - Sim/GaussTools/v6r2/src/Components/CutsStepAction.cpp and
  - GiGaTrackActionSimple.cpp so that the photons and photoelectrons
  -  are not killed and the UserTrackInformation set in GaussRICH is
  - is used for photons and photoelectrons.
  - Also added a couple of paprameters in the options file
  - for the verbosity of output and histogram activation.
  -  Three of the .cc files from G4 version 4.5.0.ref02 is 
  - copied and modifed for the optiomization and filling track related
  - UserInformation. These are in the src/srcG4 subdirectory.

! 2003-03-05 - Florence RANJARD
