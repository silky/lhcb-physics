   of predefined detectors to simulate. Two new properties of Gauss() have
   been introduced:

 - Introduce new properties in Gauss() configurable
   . Output     : string to specify the type of output, it can be 'NONE' or

                  file
   . Production : string to specify type of generation, it can be 'PHYS', 
                  'PGUN' or 'MIB' (default 'PHYS') allowing to reactivate

   compatible with Gauss v37r4 have been introduced and previous version cannot
   be used for these event types

   crossing angle required), LHC Project Note 419.
   . Beam450GeV-Velo{Open,Closed}-Mag{Down,Up}.py
 - Set beam crossing angle to 121 microrad for 5TeV beams: this is the 
   effective angle due to both external angle for full positive polarity
   of the LHCb magnet and for more than 156 bunches and the internal LHCb
   magnet crossing angle (LHC Project Note 419). Does not know external
   crossing angle for negative polarity, so leave the same effective angle

   as in previous Gauss versions, there are now separate initializations for
   the generator and simulation phases. So the initialization phase is now
   removed as such and the first step of both generator and simulation.
   The monitor phase is also split and introduced as last part of the generator
   and simulation phase separately.
   The sequencing is modified accordingly. The ParticleGun options are modified
   to remove the Generation algorithm and introduce the ParticleGun instead,
   the monitor also has to be reset to be in the right sequence.
