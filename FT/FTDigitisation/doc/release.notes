   crash at RawBankEncoder level
   Bug fix TEMPORARY recording only fired FTChannel with layer() < 12 (limit was previously set to 15, which 
   corresponds to unsensitive parts of SiPMs)
 - FTClusterCreator : (bug fix) type of meanChanPosition variable moved from 'int' to 'uint' to avoid max

!========================= FTDigitisation v1r2 2013-02-15 =======================
! 2013-02-05 - Olivier Callot
 - Set the gain to 25 photoelectrons near SIPM, i.e. before attenuation.

! 2013-01-28 - Olivier Callot
 - Add a fluctuation to the gain, to avoid a comb structure in the ADC values.

! 2013-01-25 - Olivier Callot
 - Set the default pe/MeV to 86, and teh gain to 2 cx/p.e, add adc Noise (.5 cx)
 - Eric Cogneras added plots to monitor the signals.

!========================= FTDigitisation v1r1 2012-12-12 =======================
! 2012-12-11 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration file.

! 2012-12-11 - Olivier Callot
 - Better description of the attenuation: List of length by step of 10 cm along the wire
   for the irradiated zone.
 - Corrected the reclected component, proper attenuation now.

! 2012-12-07 - Olivier Callot
 - Multi-parameter attenuation along the fibre in MCFTDepositCreator
   * Short and Long attenuation length, with their fraction.
   * Zone affected by radiation: Losange defined by xmax and ymax
   * Attenuation length at centre of this zone
   * Refelxion coefficient of the mirror
   * Cut of in reflexion due to time delay, smoothly between y min and max.
   The map of attenuation in the fibre is computed at initialization, and then
   used by interpolation for each deposit

 - Manual implementation of the poisson generation of number of photo electrons,
   to avoid re-initializing the generator for each deposit. Factor ~10 in speed.
   Use a gaussian distribution for average > 50.


!========================= FTDigitisation v1r0 2012-10-03 =======================
! 2012-08-23 - Olivier Callot
 - Change the sorting function for MCFTDigit. No longer need for the functor class...

! 2012-07-30 - Olivier Callot
 - From Eric's version, I cleaned-up a bit the code.
 - Implement proper computation of number of photo-electrons
