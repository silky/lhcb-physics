 add ONLINE_OVERRULE_MOORE_SETUP as tag to the requirements.
 This tag is used to change the setup for runMooreOnline_EFF.sh: default is to
 take the environment from $LHCBSCRIPTS/SetupMoore_vxxx.sh, which runs the
 version in the release area. If this is set, the environment corresponding
 to the checked out version of Moore is generated and used instead

   . In offline mode, any /Raw, /Rec, /MC, /Trig node that may have been 
     registered on the input file is killed by executing EventNodeKiller as the
     first TopAlg. This enables to transparently process .raw files that may or
     may not have these nodes already existing (MooreOffline.opts, LHCbAlgs v1r8)
   . Add support for OT RawBank v2 (OTDAQ v3r3, TrgForward v5r2)

     (MooreMF.opts)

   . Fix decoding of ST Raw Bank, was always decoding one word beyond end of bank
     (TrgForward v5r2)

     algorithm instead (MooreCommon.opts)
   . Load GaudiPoolDb even in online (for Event dictionary) (MooreOnline.opts)
   . RichLocalPID tools were accessing TES before the start of the event loop,
     in the beginEvent incident handler (RichLocalPID v1r12)
   . HltCompare2RawBuffer algorithm no longer tries to access RawBuffer, 
     accesses RawEvent instead (HltMonitor v1r1)

   . Fixes to bugs found during RTTC in various HLT packages, see PhysSys
     release notes for details
   . Decode again Velo RawBuffer in Reco sequence to avoid Velo tracking 
     interference with Hlt. (RecSys v1r4)
   . Do not send L1 event number with Hlt decision (GaudiOnline v1r2p1)

     + hID=3: one entry every HistoSize events, starting at event 1
     (LHCbAlgs v1r7)
   . Repackaging of Rich to allow running both Hlt and Reco in same job 
     (Not yet enabled. See LHCbSys, LbcomSys, RecSys, PhysSys release notes)

 - New tuning:

     (See LHCbSys, LbcomSys, RecSys release notes)

 - Bug fixes:
   . Load Pool persistency only in offline application
     (MooreOffline.opts, LHCbApplication.opts)
   . Set up online EventSelector in online application (MooreOnline.opts) 
   . Fix memory leaks at finalisation (XmlTools v5r3p1, DetDesc v15r2)
   . Fix memory leaks in event loop (TrgPrimVertex v4r2, TrgMuon v1r2p2)
   . If UTGID is not set, don't give a null pointer (GauchoJob v2r3)
