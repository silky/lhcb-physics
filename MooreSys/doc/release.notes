</PRE><H1><A NAME=v23r0>2014-8-17 MooreSys v23r0</A></H1><PRE>

For HLT commissioning week of the end of August. This is the first version to use ROOT 6 and should be considered as a development version. 
	
Major changes include:
    - Fix inputs of OfflineVertexFitter such that parallel particles are never used in the vertex fit.
    - Substantial updates and fixes to the flagging of used tracks and the resurrection of Hlt1 tracks, including the addition of the "Hlt1TrackOption" to Hlt2Conf.
    - Bug-fix for the use of PatForwardTool in Hlt1 that has existed since before the dawn of LHC running, with non-negligible increase in Hlt1 rate (r176r58).
    - Default to split Hlt running, running together a special case.
    - Automatic import of Hlt configurables to avoid duplication.

Also options have been added to run the juggler and L0 on 2015 MC.

-Moore now takes thresholds from HltConf when making a TCK.

-Moore_Hlt1only options kill old DecReports raw banks.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v22r1>2014-4-29 MooreSys v22r1</A></H1><PRE>

- Better configurables test separates and checks all configurables, followed by just configurables in this project. See task #50698

- Removed the temporary inclusion of DAQSys, DDDB, MuonID and HltDAQ, because they are included lower down the stack.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v22r0>2014-03-03 MooreSys v22r0</A></H1><PRE>
Moore/HLT LS1 development version and Upgrade TDR version, LHCb stack. Depends on HLT v22r0, Phys v18r0, Rec v17r0 ... Based on Gaudi v25r0. Aimed to fit the needs of the Upgrade TDR.

Major Developments:
  . C++11 :
    This is the first Moore release which allows C++11 features. 
    Therefore is only available on slc6-gcc48.
    C++11 features have been introduced throughout this stack, 
    and this constitutes the majority of changes in this release. 
    Several packages require the new C++11 features of lower projects, 
    and so several packages have had their major versions incremented.

  . Moore().OutputLevel is now WARNING by default
    By default now Moore will print a lot less output.
    Too see everything you used to see, try Moore().OutputLevel=INFO
    By default Moore now prints only some 60 -lines, which will be
    reduced even further in the next release.

  . Moore's Online-specific parts are moved to the MooreOnline project
    This means fewer options to Moore, less complicated Moore, and 
    deprecation warnings in case you try and configure these parts.
    See MooreOnline v22r0, and the module MooreScripts/MooreOnlineConf
    which contains the new configurable, MooreOnline()
    task #48780
  
  . Moore's options.
    Moore has lost over half it's options since v14r8, from 52 to 24 different slots.
    This campaign makes Moore much simpler to use. Remember:
    - L0App handles L0
    - MooreOnline handles Online configuration
    - Moore handles running HLT1 and/or 2 in an offline-like configuration

Other developments:
  . Tracking in the HLT1/2 Split:
    task #48808, task #48807.
    Tracking in the split configuration is beginning to take shape, 
    with the possibility to transfer tracks in a raw bank from Hlt1->2.

  . CMAKE dependencies:
    Almost every package has been touched to add cmake replacements 
    for the requirements files, 

  . Retirement of "castor:" protocol
    Required many of the tests to be adjusted to "root:"
    note that mdf files require "mdf:root:" to be read.

  . Removal of Persistency options of configurables:
    Moore() and L0App().Persistency have gone, since they are not needed
    task #49581

Removed packages:
  . The temporarily included packages, GaudiConf, 
    Phys/TisTobTobbing and Phys/ParticleMaker, were removed,
    since they changes are part of the stack.

Added temporary packages:
  . The following packages were temporarily added.
  . Det/DDDB: to allow the event-time to be set to Moore prefferred "Now"
  . Muon/MuonID suppress warning message during configuration
  . DAQ/DAQSys hande the case where default configurables "Alg/Alg"
    were not recognised as being the same thing as "Alg"
  . Hlt/HltDAQ to correctly add a track bank to the raw event, and decode it correctly.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v21r0>2014-01-10 MooreSys v21r0</A></H1><PRE>
Moore/HLT LS1 development version. LHCb v36r4 stack. Depends on Rec v15r4 via Phys v17r4. Based on Gaudi v24r2.

This is a Dev version For January 2014 trigger workshop and commissioning week.

This is expected to be the last HLT/Moore release compatible with slc5. 
From v22r0 we will only release for slc6 to permit incoming C++11 modifications.
This is the first Moore version to be macroscopically different from 2012 Moore.
Deferred HLT2 is now much more similar to concurrent HLT2, but there are still significant differences.

In HLT:
- Hlt/Tracking v11r0
 - See task #49515. Up-front HLT1 Velo reco is now identical to HLT2.


In MOORE:

- Hlt/Moore v21r0
 - Several minor changes in the configurable.
   . New options OutputLevel: let the user decide the verbosity of Moore. #42883
   . INFO (usual really verbose), <INFO (even more verbose), >INFO (almost silent)
   . Several deprecated options for L0 emulation, please now use L0App.
   . Reorganize options into options groups and add documentation for options (finally).
 - Migrate to DAQSys, DecoderDB, see task #19106

- Phys/TisTosTobbing v8r0
 - Implement split TisTosTob digesting, see task #48782

Temporarily added packages, ParticleMaker, DAQSys and GaudiConf for small new features.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v20r4>2013-10-09 MooreSys v20r4</A></H1><PRE>
Moore/HLT LS1 development version. LHCb v36r2 stack. Depends on Rec v15r2 via Phys v17r2. Based on Gaudi v23r10.

First Hlt/Moore version to support gcc48 :)
Otherwise very minor changes. Most changes are in the project re-organization of lower projects.

Moore/HLT LS1 development version. LHCb v36r1 stack. Depends on Rec v15r1 via Phys v17r1 via Hlt v20r3p1. Based on Gaudi v23r9.


Commissioning Hlt/Moore version for September 2013 commissioning week. Some fixes to Online configuration in Hlt/Moore, and online installation scripts moved from Hlt/Moore to MooreSys.

The split differences in v20r3p2 (Hlt2 after Hlt1 doesn't work the same as the full Hlt in one job) seem all to be due to TOS problems from being unable to locate the Hlt1Dec/SelReports, which need to be put in a new location and decoded as in the offline in the future.

Moore/HLT LS1 development version. LHCb v36r1 stack. Depends on Rec v15r1 via Phys v17r1 via Hlt v20r3p1. Based on Gaudi v23r9.

Commissioning Hlt/Moore version for September 2013 commissioning week. First Moore version to natively be able to run Hlt1 and Hlt2 independently, although the results are not identical to when they are run together.

This Hlt release picks up a branch (v2r17b) of HltDAQ to deal with multiple possible TES locations for decoded trigger banks, and also some fixes in LoKiCore.

Moore/HLT LS1 development version. LHCb v36r1 stack. Depends on Rec v15r1 via Phys v17r1. Based on Gaudi v23r9.

First version released on gcc 4.7 platform, slc6 gcc47 is expected to be *much* faster than slc5 gcc43. Real changes are only minor in the projects beneath, no significant changes in Hlt itself.

DAQ/RawEventCompat removed, now released with LHCb as v1r1.

For more information, see:
https://lhcb-tag-collector.web.cern.ch/lhcb-tag-collector/display.html?project=Hlt&version=v20r3

Moore/HLT LS1 development version. LHCb v36r0 stack. Depends on Rec v15r0 via Phys v16r5. Based on Gaudi v23r8.

New packages:
   . Add L0/L0App to handle L0 emulation, see task #42380
   . DAQ/RawEventCompat, (depends on new DBase package) to juggle around raw events.

The Project structure has been re-arranged. Now we have a different definition of the content of LHCb, Lbcom. Lbcom is now included directly in Rec.

There are minor changes in this version to address compilation on slc6 gcc47. See task #42876. This HLT version replaces v20r1p1 as the main development version.

</PRE><H1><A NAME=v20r1p1>2013-05-16 Moore v20r1p1</A></H1><PRE>
Moore/HLT LS1 development version. LHCb v35r5 stack. Depends on Rec v14r5 via Phys v16r5. Based on Gaudi v23r7.

Moore version intended to be used for HLT splitting commissioning in the May 2013 commissioning week.

Two major fixes made:
 - postConfigure fix all PVlocations to replace OnOfflineTool behaviour.
 - ensure each ISMUON functor has a previous HASMUON functor to suppress loki warnings

Other modifications:
 - testing improved a lot, now Moore tests running with vdm, passthrough and physics
   are sensitive to legitimate problems.

Disclaimer: This Moore version does not behave identically to 2012 trigger differences are at the %-level, nominally v20r1p1 selects fewer events, but the majority of the modifications seem to be from changes in FastVelo.

To see what has changed take a look at the test references for moore.physics.2012 test.

 take the environment from $LHCBSCRIPTS/SetupMoore_vxxx.sh, which runs the
 version in the release area. If this is set, the environment corresponding
 to the checked out version of Moore is generated and used instead

   . In offline mode, any /Raw, /Rec, /MC, /Trig node that may have been
     registered on the input file is killed by executing EventNodeKiller as the
     first TopAlg. This enables to transparently process .raw files that may or
     may not have these nodes already existing (MooreOffline.opts, LHCbAlgs v1r8)
   . Add support for OT RawBank v2 (OTDAQ v3r3, TrgForward v5r2)

     algorithm instead (MooreCommon.opts)
   . Load GaudiPoolDb even in online (for Event dictionary) (MooreOnline.opts)
   . RichLocalPID tools were accessing TES before the start of the event loop,
     in the beginEvent incident handler (RichLocalPID v1r12)
   . HltCompare2RawBuffer algorithm no longer tries to access RawBuffer,
     accesses RawEvent instead (HltMonitor v1r1)

 - Bug fixes:
   . Load Pool persistency only in offline application
     (MooreOffline.opts, LHCbApplication.opts)
   . Set up online EventSelector in online application (MooreOnline.opts)
   . Fix memory leaks at finalisation (XmlTools v5r3p1, DetDesc v15r2)
   . Fix memory leaks in event loop (TrgPrimVertex v4r2, TrgMuon v1r2p2)
   . If UTGID is not set, don't give a null pointer (GauchoJob v2r3)
