# SUMMARY OF THIS TEST
# ...................
# Author: rlambert
# Purpose: Test deferral running Hlt2 after Hlt1
# Prerequisites: at least the physics.2012 and the physics.deferral.hlt1only need to have completed first.
# Common failure modes, severities and cures: 
#               . SEVERE: Segfault or raised exception, stderr, nonzero return code
#               . MAJOR: additional FATAL/ERROR messages always a major problem. no ERROR messages should ever be printed when running this test.
#               . MINOR: additional WARNING messages, it is unclear how severe these may be, you will need to hunt down the cause and either fix the problem or suppress the warning.
#               . EXPECTED: Unfortunately Hlt2 after 1 does not currently behave the same as Hlt2 along side 1, and this is something to be understood and fixed. https://savannah.cern.ch/task/?49544
