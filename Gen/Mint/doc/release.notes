!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!=========================== Mint v3r2 2014-12-17 ============================
! 2014-11-19 - Marco Clemencic
 - Updated CMake configuration

! 2014-10-15 - Jeremy
 - Added spin factor for wKs added

!=========================== Mint v3r1 2014-09-02 ============================
! 2014-07-24 - Jeremy
 - Minor bug fixes

! 2014-07-22 - Jeremy
 - Added two new lineshapes for the non-resonant component
  . Exponential and power law
  . At present, their shape parameters cannot be floated
 - In steering file, indicate with ExpNonResD0 or PowNonResD0 keyword
 - Lineshapes need to be manually added NamedDecayTreeList.cpp to each isobar
  . add(AmpInitialiser(*dk, "ExpNonRes"));
  . add(AmpInitialiser(*dk, "PowNonRes"));

! 2014-05-16 - Jeremy
 - Restore ability to use normalised barrier factors in amplitudes
  . Control in steering file by setting "NormBF" to 1
  . Default behaviour is to use unnormalised barrier factors
  . Note that normalised barrier factors violate conservation of total angular momentum x-(

! 2014-05-16 - Jeremy
 - root 5.34.18 compatibility updates

! 2014-03-04 - Claire
 - added method getP() to DalitzEvent which gives back the vector of the four-momenta of all particles in the event
 - build an automatic rejection factor into DalitzMCMC generation
 - added different constructors to DalitzMCMC
 - new class DalitzMCMC_corrPairs that generates correlated events
 - new class DalitzEventPairList that stores std::pair of events

! 2014-02-07 - Jeremy
 - Bug fix in Gounaris-Sakurai function
 - Treat GS in the same way as other lineshapes
  . Deprecate GSSpinFactor

! 2014-02-05 - Jeremy
 - Deprecate CrystalBallRhoOmega
 - Create new Rho0Omega lineshape to describe rho-omega mixing
  . Now the default rho-omega lineshape used by calling RHO_OMEGA in the steering file
 - Warning added to CrystalBarrelFOCUS
  . Contains many issues and bugs, only kept for backwards compatibility
  . Keyword for usage changed to WRONG_RHOOMEGA in the steering file
  . Hope to deprecate one day

!=========================== Mint v3r0 2014-01-30 ============================
! 2014-01-24 - Jeremy 
 - Move FocusFlatte to Flatte
 - Deprecate FocusFlatte
 - Fixed a bug in the new Flatte
  . When the phase space factor was negative, the phase space factor was returned as a complex number
  . Should square root the absolute value first, then return as a complex number
  . Changed default values of gpipi and gkk/gpipi to BES values

! 2014-01-24 - Jeremy
 - Non-resonant "particles" now have an associated barrier factor

! 2014-01-24 - Matt Coombes
 - Fixed compile warning in IMintGen.h by adding virtual destructor.

! 2014-01-22 - Matt
 - Fixed compile warning in DalitzBoxSet.cpp L78 _ready(_ready) -> _ready(other._ready)
 - Fixed compile warning in EvtTRandom.h by adding virtual destructor.

! 2014-01-21 - Jeremy
 - Fixed an issue with the LASS function where the units of the Breit-Wigner 
   were different to the non-resonant component

! 2014-01-17 - Jeremy
 - Lineshape of Breit_wigner now multiplied by the unnormalised Barrier Factors 
   instead of the normalised versions
  . The Breit-Wigner mass-dependent width itself still uses the normalised 
    version as it should

! 2014-01-16 - Jeremy
 - Fixed an issue where the PDG mass of a non-resonant particle was set to 999
  . This led to the breakup momentum of the D0, q0_D0 being negative and then reset to 0
  . This led to a wrong barrier factor
  . In the case of non-resonant particles, the reconstructed mass is now used

! 2014-01-08 - Jeremy
 - Added a new class DalitzMCMC that allows MC generation using a Markov Chain algorithm
  . Note that small samples of DalitzMCMC are inherently biased
  . Generate a huge sample of MCMC first, then draw events randomly from that

!=========================== Mint v2r2 2013-10-10 ============================
! 2013-10-02 - Philip Hunt (LHCb)
 - Added the EvtTRandom class, which inherits from TRandom and allows the
   EvtGen-MINT generator to use the EvtGen random number generator
  . Takes as a constructor argument an IEvtRandom object, which is implemented
    in the EvtGenExtras package
 - Modified IMintGen::Initialize to accept a TRandom as an argument
 - Modified some of the MintGen methods
  . Initialize now has the ability to set the random number generator of the
    SignalGenerator 
  . Fixed typo in one of the method names ("getDaugtherMom"->"getDaughterMom")

! 2013-09-23 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration file.
