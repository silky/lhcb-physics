!=========================== Mint v1r3 2012-05-14 ============================
! 14-05-2012 - Matt Coombes
- Added capability to delete SCP bins
- Added DTF capability with ReadNTuple

! 17-02-2012 - Matt Coombes
- Fixed bug in ReadNTuple.h to allow any NTuple to be read by MINT
  
! 08-02-2012 - Matt Coombes
- Added PhaseBinning.h. Allowing users to bin phase space in constant phase
  and constant phase difference.

! 24-01-2012 - Matt Coombes
- Added Capability to Save and open Miranda binning.
  Bins are saved in NTuple format saving the max and min in each projection
  Functions can be found in SCPBinning class. SetBinning(const char* filename) 
  and Save(const char* filename).

! 23-01-2012 - Matt Coombes
- Added ReadNTuple.h gives capability to read in any NTuple
  and save as DiskResidentEventList

! 28-12-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Removed some unnecessary print statements.
 
! 23-12-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Added Capability to plot all amps on fit histo
 - Changed title to show particles.
 
! 05-12-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Fixed Binning for SCP stack histo
 - Compressed warnings in FitAmpPair.cpp
 - Removed debugging statement left in DalitzEvent.cpp
   
! 01-12-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Added contructor to DiskResidentEventList to use a given tree name and 
   scale events. This should be used for MC not for data.
 
! 24-11-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Changes to DiskResidentEventList to use a given tree name
 - Updated from NTuple in DaltizEvent
 
! 24-11-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Introduction of Miranda Method within MINT

! 15-11-2011 - Jonas Rademacker

!=========================== Mint v1r2 2011-11-11 ============================

! 04-11-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Minor updates to ParticlePropertiesList

!=========================== Mint v1r1 2011-10-17 ============================

! 25-10-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Updates to particle properties
 - Introduction of Chi2 binning
   

!=========================== Mint v1r0 2011-09-10 ============================

! 25-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Changed D_hhhh.cpp to generate cc of Decay using same amplitude model as decay.
 - Also updated input to be reference to speed things up.
   
! 25-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - General debugging after running in nightly builds
 - Fixed requirements to produce libraries correctly
 - Fixed ../src/Mint/Pareto/src/GeneralisedPareto.cpp(119): warning #68: 
   integer conversion resulted in a change of sign unsigned int n=-9999;
 - Fixed FitFraction.h(28): warning #858: type qualifier on return type is meaningless
   const double sigmaInteg() const{return _sigmaInteg;}.
 
 
! 19-08-2011 - Jonas Rademacker
 - Modified SpinFactors4 so the spin factors actually print themselves 
   correctly upon construction 
 - there were problems with inherited spin factors previously, 
   who thought they were their own parents. 
 - I also added KKpipiAmpFit/ampFit.cpp again

! 19-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Moved header files back into exported directory Mint/
   with flat directory structure so that include statements are simple
 - Corrected all include statements accordingly
 - Added missing AmpFit.cpp to Users area
 - Removed directory structure under Mint/
 
 
! 18-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Moved header files back into exported directory Mint/
   this now has directory structure which has changed imports a bit
 - Renamed some files incorrectly named Namecpp - added dot back
 - Updated Makefiles to take into account the changes.
 
! 17-08-2011 - Jonas Rademacker
 - Added DalitzFits/4pi_gamma 
   as method for fitting for gamma using 4pi model

! 17-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Created Interface IMintGen.h
 - Moved header files to private
 - Export only IMintGen.h
 - Corrected Include statements to return to 'old' structure
 
! 16-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Major changes to structure in order to release into Gauss
 - Introduced test/ folder for test jobs.
 - Test .C files renamed as .cpp
 - Test files now call header files from Mint/
 
! 15-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Major changes to structure in order to release into Gauss
 - Introduced Mint/ folder with exported header files
 - All Mint header files must now be imported with #import "Mint/header.h"
 - Renamed all source .C files with .cpp. Needed in order to release
 
! 10-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Edited ParticlePropertiesList.C to find .cvs files using $MINTROOT
 - Added MoelNotes.txt to describe the models included within MINT
 - Included models folder containing 3 current models to be used in production
 - Implemented model naming format clearly visible and consistent with EvtModel

  
! 18-07-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Cleaned up Dalitz Event removed DecayD.C and .h
  Instead use exterior interface to interact directly with Gauss

! 06-07-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Replaced Mojito Makefile with a new Makefile from Jonas
 - Updated MINT version to most recent local improvements by Jonas.

! 03-04-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - First Added MINT to LHCb framework
