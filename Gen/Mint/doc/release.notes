! Purpose     : Original author of MINT Dr. Jonas Rademacker.
!               Matt Coombes has task of implementing MINT into LHCb framework.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 05-12-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Fixed Binning for SCP stack histo
 - Compressed warnings in FitAmpPair.cpp
 - Removed debugging statement left in DalitzEvent.cpp
   
! 01-12-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Added contructor to DiskResidentEventList to use a given tree name and 
   scale events. This should be used for MC not for data.
 
! 24-11-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Changes to DiskResidentEventList to use a given tree name
 - Updated from NTuple in DaltizEvent
 
! 24-11-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Introduction of Miranda Method within MINT

! 15-11-2011 - Jonas Rademacker
 - Add A1 D-wave decay to K3pi model 
 
!=========================== Mint v1r2 2011-11-11 ============================

! 04-11-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Minor updates to ParticlePropertiesList

!=========================== Mint v1r1 2011-10-17 ============================

! 25-10-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Updates to particle properties
 - Introduction of Chi2 binning
   

!=========================== Mint v1r0 2011-09-10 ============================

! 25-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Changed D_hhhh.cpp to generate cc of Decay using same amplitude model as decay.
 - Also updated input to be reference to speed things up.
   
! 25-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - General debugging after running in nightly builds
 - Fixed requirements to produce libraries correctly
 - Fixed ../src/Mint/Pareto/src/GeneralisedPareto.cpp(119): warning #68: 
   integer conversion resulted in a change of sign unsigned int n=-9999;
 - Fixed FitFraction.h(28): warning #858: type qualifier on return type is meaningless
   const double sigmaInteg() const{return _sigmaInteg;}.
 
 
! 19-08-2011 - Jonas Rademacker
 - Modified SpinFactors4 so the spin factors actually print themselves 
   correctly upon construction 
 - there were problems with inherited spin factors previously, 
   who thought they were their own parents. 
 - I also added KKpipiAmpFit/ampFit.cpp again

! 19-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Moved header files back into exported directory Mint/
   with flat directory structure so that include statements are simple
 - Corrected all include statements accordingly
 - Added missing AmpFit.cpp to Users area
 - Removed directory structure under Mint/
 
 
! 18-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Moved header files back into exported directory Mint/
   this now has directory structure which has changed imports a bit
 - Renamed some files incorrectly named Namecpp - added dot back
 - Updated Makefiles to take into account the changes.
 
! 17-08-2011 - Jonas Rademacker
 - Added DalitzFits/4pi_gamma 
   as method for fitting for gamma using 4pi model

! 17-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Created Interface IMintGen.h
 - Moved header files to private
 - Export only IMintGen.h
 - Corrected Include statements to return to 'old' structure
 
! 16-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Major changes to structure in order to release into Gauss
 - Introduced test/ folder for test jobs.
 - Test .C files renamed as .cpp
 - Test files now call header files from Mint/
 
! 15-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Major changes to structure in order to release into Gauss
 - Introduced Mint/ folder with exported header files
 - All Mint header files must now be imported with #import "Mint/header.h"
 - Renamed all source .C files with .cpp. Needed in order to release
 
! 10-08-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Edited ParticlePropertiesList.C to find .cvs files using $MINTROOT
 - Added MoelNotes.txt to describe the models included within MINT
 - Included models folder containing 3 current models to be used in production
 - Implemented model naming format clearly visible and consistent with EvtModel

  
! 18-07-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Cleaned up Dalitz Event removed DecayD.C and .h
  Instead use exterior interface to interact directly with Gauss

! 06-07-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - Replaced Mojito Makefile with a new Makefile from Jonas
 - Updated MINT version to most recent local improvements by Jonas.

! 03-04-2011 - Matt Coombes
 - First Added MINT to LHCb framework
