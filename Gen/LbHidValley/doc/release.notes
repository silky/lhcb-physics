 - new package.

   The actual lines are extracted from the original code HV4.403 by 
   Matt Strassler <strasslr@noether.phys.washington.edu>

  Short description by Matt Strassler:
  ====================================
  """ 

   My new program is aimed at the types of events that occur in

   Echoes of a hidden valley at hadron colliders.
   Matthew J. Strassler, Kathryn M. Zurek (Washington U., Seattle) . Apr
   2006. 5pp.  e-Print Archive: hep-ph/0604261

   These events are much richer in structure -- the number of displaced vertices
   per event can be much larger than two, though the total number 
   of events might be quite abit smaller.

   The experimental techniques you are developing would ideally be 
   sensitive to many types of new physics, including both the physics of 
   these two papers above, and the physics discussed (and earlier 
   papers briefly reviewed) in

   Possible effects of a hidden valley on supersymmetric phenomenology.
   Matthew J. Strassler (Washington U., Seattle) . Jul 2006. 10pp.
   e-Print Archive: hep-ph/0607160

   whereby LHCb can discover supersymmetry. 

   """

   The package contains 2 constitients

   - standalone executable HidValley.exe  [depends only on Pythia]
     with comman-dline interfaces,  
     which is able to produce the partonic events in 
     new LHE-output (xml-like) format

   - Gaudi component "HidValleyProduction" to perform the actual 
     simulation within Gauss framework
