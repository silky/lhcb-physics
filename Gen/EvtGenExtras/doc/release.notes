!======================= EvtGenExtras v1r0 2009-02-09 ========================

! 2009-02-09 - Will REECE
 - Adds a new model for the decay of Bd->K*mumu based on work with 
   A. Bhurucha. Reference for theory side is arXiv:0811.1214 (hep-ph).
   The model is stable and will compile but is *not validated*, and so 
   should not yet be used for production jobs.

! 2009-01-20 - Will REECE
 - New Package

   Initial version for testing, including a dummy model.
   Allows extra models to be passed into EvtGen at runtime.
   These models are provided as a list using the method
   EvtModelRegExtras::getModels(). This can be uses in the
   situation where it is desirable to include a new model,
   but not introduce extra external dependencies for the EvtGen
   package itself.
