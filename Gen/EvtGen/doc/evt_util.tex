\section{The routines {\tt decay\_angle} and {\tt decay\_angle\_chi}}
\label{sect:evtutil}

This section will describe two utility routines, 
{\tt decay\_angle} and  {\tt decay\_angle\_chi},
that compute decay angles.  The function {\tt decay\_angle} is 
useful for finding the decay angle, as known as the helicity
angle, in a decay tree that includes a two body decay.
{\tt decay\_angle\_chi} computes the azimuthal angle between two decay
planes in sequencial decays such as $B \rightarrow D^* D^*$ or
$B \rightarrow D^* \ell \nu$.

To call to {\tt decay\_angle}, the syntax is 
\begin{verbatim} 
costheta=decay_angle(P,Q,D),
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt P}, {\tt Q} and {\tt D} are of type {\tt EvtVector4R}.
This routine returns the cosine of the angle $\theta$, as defined in
Figure~\ref{fig:decay_angle}. The decay angle calculated is that between
the flight direction of the 
daughter meson, {\tt D}, in the rest frame of {\tt Q} (the parent of {\tt D}),
with respect to {\tt Q}'s
flight direction in {\tt P}'s (the parent of {\tt Q})
rest frame. {\tt P}, {\tt Q}, and {\tt D}
are the momentum four vectors of these particles in any frame of reference.
The decay angle is
computed using the (manifestly invariant) expression
\begin{equation}
\cos\theta = { {(P\cdot D) M^2_Q- (P\cdot Q)(Q\cdot D)} \over
        	      \sqrt{[(P\cdot Q)^2-M^2_QM^2_P]
		[(Q\cdot D)^2-M^2_QM^2_D]}}.
\end{equation}


The routine {\tt decay\_angle\_chi} is used to calculate the azimuthal 
angel, $\chi$, between the decay planes of a pair of two body
decays.
As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:decay_angle_chi},
$\chi$ is the
angle 
calculated from the particle {\tt d1} to the particle {\tt h1} as
seen from the direction of particle {\tt D}. The form of the call to this 
subroutine is 
\begin{verbatim} 
chi=decay_angle_chi(p4_parent,p4_d1,p4_d2,p4_h1,p4_h2),
\end{verbatim} 

where {\tt p4\_d1}, {\tt p4\_d2}, {\tt p4\_t1}, {\tt p4\_h2}
are of type {\tt EvtVector4R} and are the four momenta
of the daughter particles as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:decay_angle_chi}.
