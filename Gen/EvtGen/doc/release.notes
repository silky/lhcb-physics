    ATLAS code, not maintain by LHCb, not modified
    an event generator that is well suited for B physics.
    It implements many detailed models that are important for the physics of 
    B mesons. In particular, it has detailed models for semileptonic decays, 
    CP-violating decays and produces correct results for the angular 
    distributions in sequential decays, including all correlations.
    It also has an interface to JetSet for generation of continuum at the 
    Upsilon(4S) and for generic hadronic decays, e.g. of B mesons, that are 
    not implemented in the generator.
