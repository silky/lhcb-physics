First version of the LHCb digitization program.
  - Replaces the digitization and trigger phases of Brunel
  - Produces output to be reconstructed by Brunel v20r0

This verson is based on digitization+trigger phases of Brunel v19r1.

Changes relative to Brunel v19r1
--------------------------------

Event model changes:
 - Boole cannot read oorawh files produced with SicbToOORawh v1r* due to changes
   in the Calo and Rich MC Hit definitions. Use data converted with SicbToOORawh
   v2r*

Bug fixes:
 - Correct a bug with rotation of TT stereo layers (ITDet v1r5)
