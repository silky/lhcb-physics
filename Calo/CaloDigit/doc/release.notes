 - Based on the old algorithms, restructuration in 3 phases, conversion to 
   CaloAlgorithms

  o CaloSignalAlg transform the MCHits into MCCaloDigit, taking into account
    the TIME information from SICBMC v255, i.e. given by BX number. The 
    previous BX is also converted to MCCaloDigit as this is neede for the
    spill over processing of Prs/Spd.

  o CaloDigitAlg transforms the MCCaloDigits to CaloDigits for all cells, 
    adding noise, gain fluctuations, photo-electron statistics, correcting for
    the 15% (option) of the previous signal (with photo-electron fluctuation) 
    for Prs and Spd, ...

  o CaloZSupAlg peforms the 1D or 2D zero suppression, producing the final
    container for calorimeter reconstruction. This is as close as possible
    to the output of the CROP.
  
   Monitoring and algorithm to produce pseudo-raw-data should be added...
